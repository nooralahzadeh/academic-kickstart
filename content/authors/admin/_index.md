bio: I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Language Technology group at University of Oslo. Before starting a Phd,  I was a research engineer at the Inria Sophia-Antipolis research center in the WIMMICS team.  Prior to that, I spent one year in the Parsing and Semantics Group at Xerox Research Center Europe in Grenoble (France). I got my master from Erasmus mundus master program in Data mining and Knowledge Management. My research focuses on domain adapted information extraction for oil and gas , where we collaborate with the industry in SIRIUS centre to provide scalable data access tools for oil and gas domain. Currently, I am on the research stay at Copenhagen NLU research group to work on Joint domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods.
